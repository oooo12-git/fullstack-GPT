      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 cup of rice\n",
      "- 1 cup of water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of nuruk (fermentation starter)\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of yeast\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.\n",
      "2. In a large pot, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked.\n",
      "3. Remove the pot from heat and let it cool to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a separate bowl, mix the nuruk and yeast with a little bit of warm water to form a paste.\n",
      "5. Add the rice to the nuruk and yeast mixture and mix well.\n",
      "6. Transfer the mixture to a clean glass jar and cover with a clean cloth.\n",
      "7. Let the mixture ferment at room temperature for 7-10 days, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "8. After the fermentation process is complete, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any solids.\n",
      "9. Transfer the liquid to a clean bottle and store in the refrigerator.\n",
      "10. Serve the soju chilled and enjoy! Ingredients:\n",
      "- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 packet active dry yeast\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups warm water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon sugar\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n",
      "3. Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.\n",
      "5. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place the loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n",
      "6. Cover the loaf with a clean towel and let it rise for another 30 minutes.\n",
      "7. Bake the bread in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "8. Let the bread cool before slicing and serving. Enjoy! /n\n",
